Strategic Chunk Placement\n- Position most relevant chunks at the boundaries (beginning/end)\n- Place less relevant chunks in the middle if needed\n- Re-rank retrieved results before inserting into context\n\n### 2. Limit Retrieved Content\n- Quality over quantity\n- Fewer highly relevant chunks beats many partially relevant ones\n- Rank by semantic relevance, not just similarity scores\n\n### 3. Context Condensing\n- Summarize multiple sources before insertion\n- Preserve key information density\n- Remove redundant information\n\n### 4. Architecture Changes\n- Use hierarchical summarization before full context\n- Implement re-ranking steps after initial retrieval\n- Consider multiple retrieval passes with refinement\n\n## Model Size Doesn't Fix It\nLarger models show the same pattern.

  Tool: write_file({"content": "# Context Engineering for AI Agents: Comprehensive Research Summary\n\n**Date:** Research completed recently  \n**Topic:** Context engineering concepts, best practices, and techniques for AI agents\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

[References](#references)\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nContext engineering is the deliberate design and management of the information context provided to AI agents to optimize their performance, reliability, and efficiency. As AI agents become more sophisticated, the strategic handling of context\u2014how it's structured, presented, sized, and maintained\u2014has emerged as a critical discipline separate from but complementary to prompt engineering.\n\nThis report synthesizes current research and best practices from leading AI organizations including Anthropic, OpenAI, and academic institutions. Key findings include the well-documented \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon where LLMs struggle to utilize information placed in the middle of long contexts, and practical strategies for optimizing context usage in production agent systems.\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n### What is Context Engineering?\n\nContext engineering encompasses the systematic approach to designing, structuring, and managing the information context that AI agents receive during interactions. Unlike general prompt engineering, context engineering focuses specifically on:\n\n- **Context Structure**: How information is organized and presented\n- **Context Size**: How much information is included (token management)\n- **Context Timing**: When information is loaded or refreshed\n- **Context Maintenance**: How context is preserved across multi-turn interactions\n\n### Types of Context in AI Agents\n\n| Context Type | Description | Typical Stability |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **System Context** | Instructions, role definitions, behavioral guidelines | Static |\n| **Tool Context** | Descriptions of available tools and parameters | Semi-static |\n| **Task Context** | Current task description, goals, constraints | Dynamic |\n| **Conversation History** | Previous messages and responses | Dynamic |\n| **Retrieved Context** | Information from external sources (RAG) | Dynamic |\n\n### Context Windows\n\nA context window is the maximum number of tokens an LLM can process in a single request. Modern models support context windows ranging from 128K to 200K+ tokens. However, **having a large context window doesn't mean you should use it all**:\n\n- Every token costs money and consumes model attention\n- Performance degrades as context length increases\n- The \"lost in the middle\" problem affects long contexts\n\n---\n\n## The \"Lost in the Middle\" Problem\n\n### Research Background\n\nThis phenomenon was documented in the paper \"Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts\" by Liu et al. (2023) at the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n### Key Findings\n\nThe research reveals a **U-shaped performance curve** when relevant information is placed at different positions in a long context:\n\n| Position in Context | Model Performance |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **Beginning** | High (recency effect) |\n| **Middle** | Significantly degraded |\n| **End** | High (primacy effect) |\n\n### Critical Insights\n\n1. **Information in the middle is often ignored or underweighted** by the model's attention mechanism\n2. **Performance degrades with total context length**, even when information is at optimal positions\n3. **Model size doesn't fix the problem**\u2014larger models show the same pattern\n4. **This is a fundamental architectural limitation** of current transformer-based models\n\n### Implications for RAG Systems\n\nFor Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, this finding has significant practical implications:\n\n- Simply retrieving more chunks doesn't improve (and may hurt) performance\n- If the most relevant chunk ends up in the middle of context, performance degrades\n- Re-ranking retrieved results is essential before inserting into context\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices and Techniques\n\n### 1. Strategic Context Placement\n\n**Follow the \"boundaries matter\" principle:**\n\n```\n[INSTRUCTIONS]  \u2190 Best for critical rules and role definition\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Boundary\n[Background context]\n[Retrieved information]\n[Less critical details]  \u2190 Middle (less likely to be attended to)\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Boundary\n[TASK SPECIFIC INFO]  \u2190 Best for current task requirements\n```\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Place the most critical instructions at the very beginning\n- Put task-specific requirements and current query at the end\n- Use clear section headers to help the model parse information\n- Avoid burying important details in large blocks of middle content\n\n### 2. Token Management\n\n| Strategy | Description | Benefit |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| **Keep context focused** | Only include truly relevant information | Reduces noise, lowers costs |\n| **Progressive disclosure** | Load information on-demand rather than all at once | Better attention allocation |\n| **Summarization** | Compress long histories while preserving key facts | Efficient token usage |\n| **Remove redundancy** | Eliminate duplicate or low-signal content | Improves signal-to-noise |\n\n### 3. Prompt Caching\n\nPrompt caching is a feature offered by providers like Anthropic that optimizes API usage by caching frequently used context:\n\n**How it works:**\n- The API stores a hash of your prompt prefix\n- Subsequent requests with the same prefix reuse cached computation\n- Content must be at least 1024 tokens to be cached\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Cache stable content: system prompts, tool descriptions, few-shot examples\n- Place dynamic content (user queries, variable data) after cached content\n- Monitor cache hits through response headers\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Up to 85% latency reduction for cached content\n- Lower costs through avoiding re-processing\n- Improved throughput for high-volume applications\n\n### 4. Structured Format\n\nUse consistent formatting to help models parse context effectively:\n\n- **Delimiters**: Mark distinct sections with clear markers\n- **Typed inputs**: Use JSON Schema for tool parameters\n- **Output specifications**: Explicitly state desired format\n- **Section headers**: Help model navigate long contexts\n\n### 5. Advanced Prompting Techniques\n\n| Technique | Description | Use Case |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Chain-of-Thought** | Encourage step-by-step reasoning | Complex reasoning tasks |\n| **Self-Consistency** | Generate multiple paths, take majority | Reliability improvement |\n| **Tree of Thoughts** | Explore multiple reasoning branches | Creative problem-solving |\n| **Few-shot Learning** | Provide examples of desired behavior | Pattern matching tasks |\n\n### 6. Iterative Refinement Process\n\n```\nStart with basic prompt\n        \u2193\nTest on representative examples\n        \u2193\nAnalyze failures and identify patterns\n        \u2193\nRefine prompt based on findings\n        \u2193\nRepeat until convergence\n```\n\n---\n\n## Practical Recommendations for Agent Developers\n\n### Start Simple\n\n1. **Begin with the simplest possible agent architecture**\n   - Single tool with clear purpose\n   - Linear workflow without branching\n   - Explicit success criteria\n\n2. **Add complexity gradually, only when evidence shows it's needed**\n   - Validate single-agent performance before multi-agent systems\n   - Test thoroughly at each complexity level\n\n### Design Effective Tools\n\n| Aspect | Best Practice |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Descriptions** | Explain what the tool does AND when to use it |\n| **Inputs** | Use JSON Schema to define expected parameters |\n| **Outputs** | Return data the model can interpret and act on |\n| **Errors** | Provide actionable guidance when things fail |\n\n### Implement Robust Context Management\n\n1. **Be deliberate about every token** \u2014 context is precious\n2. **Use structured format** for easier parsing\n3. **Implement progressive disclosure** \u2014 load information on-demand\n4. **Summarize long histories** while preserving key facts\n5. **Place critical information at boundaries** (start or end)\n\n### Design for Error Recovery\n\n1. **Give models explicit permission to retry** when things fail\n2. **Provide diagnostic information** in error messages\n3. **Set clear stopping conditions** to prevent infinite loops\n4. **Log everything** for debugging and iteration\n\n### Debugging Strategies\n\n1. **Capture full reasoning traces** including thinking blocks\n2. **Identify where understanding diverged** from reality\n3. **Look for patterns**: tool confusion, goal drift, context loss\n4. **Use interleaved thinking models** that show reasoning between tool calls\n\n---\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Description | Solution |\n|--------------|-------------|----------|\n| **Over-engineering** | Building complex systems before validating simple ones | Start simple, add complexity incrementally |\n| **Vague tool descriptions** | Unclear when to use each tool | Provide specific usage criteria |\n| **Context overload** | Stuffing too much information | Keep context focused and relevant |\n| **No exit conditions** | Agents run indefinitely | Set clear stopping conditions |\n| **Ambiguous instructions** | \"Make it better\" without specifics | Be explicit about desired outcomes |\n| **Assuming knowledge** | Model doesn't know your domain | Provide necessary context explicitly |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n### Primary Sources\n\n1. **Anthropic Research - Building Effective Agents**\n   - URL: https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents\n   - Covers core principles, tool design, context management, and error handling\n\n2. **\"Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts\" (Liu et al., 2023)**\n   - URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172\n   - Research paper documenting the U-shaped attention phenomenon\n\n3. **Anthropic Documentation - Prompt Caching**\n   - URL: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching\n   - Technical guide to implementing prompt caching\n\n4. **OpenAI - Prompt Engineering Best Practices**\n   - URL: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering\n   - Official guide covering six key strategies for better results\n\n5. **Prompt Engineering Guide (DAIR.AI)**\n   - URL: https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques\n   - Comprehensive guide to prompting techniques\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n6. **LangChain - Debugging AI Agents**\n   - URL: https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/debugging\n   - Patterns for debugging complex agent workflows\n\n7. **Weights & Biases - LLM Observability**\n   - URL: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/prompts\n   - Tools for tracking and debugging LLM applications\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nContext engineering is an emerging discipline critical to building effective AI agents.
